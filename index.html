                <p>I'm Mary, an Israeli product designer who often travels the world, trying to find myself; in me and outside of me, to be kind and feel good. Currently, in my free time, I am exploring code - you are welcome to scroll down and check my humble playground.</p>

                <h2>My Passion</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was a kid, art has been my safe place. I loved losing myself in colors and shapes, bringing my imagination to life. As I grew older, I realized I could use this passion in my daily life. Today, as a UX designer, I get to combine art, technology, and problem-solving to create users' digital interfaces.</p>

                <h2>Design Journey</h2>
                <p>After studying art history, I took a detour into graphic design and fell in love with UX. To learn the ins and outs of this new field, I dove into online courses, tutorials, and real-world projects. Since then, I've had the chance to work on projects with the mobile apps team at Wix.com. There, I honed my skills in tackling challenges, understanding user needs, translating them into design solutions, and seeing the impact my work has on people's lives.</p>

                <h2>My Belief</h2>
                <p>I believe that great design is more than just aesthetics. It's about creating experiences that are not only beautiful but also functional, accessible, and delightful. I'm curious to learn, to be in the student shoes, to grow but also to chill and enjoy life and be present. I truly believe it's one of the keys to being good at your job. I'm excited to see where the future of design will take us.
